A re-implementation of <span class="vcard"><a class="fn url" href="http://nickm.com">Nick Montfort</a>'s <a rel="http://www.amirrorclear.net/flowers/game/devours/"><cite style="font-style:italic;">Amazing Quest</cite></a></span>, from IFComp 2020, in Python.

## `direct_translation.py`

## `reimplemention.py`
A much-streamlined version of the program, simplified largely by avoiding reimplementing the BASIC-based READ/DATA logic.
