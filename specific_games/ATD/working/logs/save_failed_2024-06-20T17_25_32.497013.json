    "A quick noise from behind, then a strong grip on your wrist. The guard is\n  back -- time has slipped away from you.\n\n  Deaf to your protests, the guard disarms your bomb, handcuffs you and\n  forces you into a dark sedan. You speed through the chill Boston night,\n  head held in your hands, almost oblivious to the blur of the suburbs\n  rushing past.\n\n  Half an hour later, the car pulls up outside a non-descript building and\n  you are dragged inside then thrown into a small cell to await questioning.\n\n  *******\n\n  Wednesday 13th October 2004\n\n  At precisely 9:27 am this morning a catastrophe of unprecedented scale\n  occurred. An immense explosion -- that could only have been atomic in\n  nature -- tore through the city and suburbs of Boston MA, destroying all in\n  its path. Casualties are expected to number in the millions. The President\n.\n   The Deutsch Laboratory                               4:23:05 am\n.\n  has declared a state of emergency across the nation and the military is\n  mobilizing for a possible war with the as yet unknown enemy.\n\n  This thing all things devours:\n  birds, beasts, trees, flowers;\n  gnaws iron, bites steel;\n  grinds hard stones to meal;\n  slays king, ruins town;\n  and beats high mountain down.\n.\n      *** You have failed ***\n.\n  Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, UNDO your last move or\n  QUIT?\n> >    The Deutsch Laboratory                               4:23:05 am\n.\n  Please give one of the answers above.",
