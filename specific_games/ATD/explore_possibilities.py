"""A quick hack to explore the possibility space in All Things Devours, a piece
of interactive fiction published by Toby Ord (under the name "half sick of
shadows") in 2004. ATD is a tight little puzzle game involving time-travel;
part of its appeal is how tightly interlocked the elements of the various
puzzles are with each other and how solutions to one puzzle put constraints on
other puzzles. At the same time, having played through to a solution, it's easy
to wonder how many other ways the puzzles could be solved. This script is an
attempt to explore that question.

It "plays" ATD repeatedly, making all possible sequences of moves, looking for
those that result in successful outcomes and reporting them. It's also
interested in overcoming a technical limitation of the original, the maximum-
simultaneous-time-travel hard limit of 2; this script plays a hacked version of
ATD that has room for up to 16 different simultaneous interactions. (SURELY
there couldn't be room for THAT MANY simultaneous copies moving around the map
at the same time.)

This script is copyright 2019 by Patrick Mooney. It is released under the GPL,
either version 3 or (at your option) any later version. See the file LICENSE
