# `Optimization/`

Output of various versions of the script, including timing information, as the script is converted from pure-Python to Cython. These occur in both plain-text format and <a rel="muse" href="https://asciinema.org/">ASCIInema</a> JSON (as `.cast` files). ASCIInama `.cast` files are recorded with a terminal size of 150&nbsp;x&nbsp30.

The standard invocation of the script for timing purposes is something very close to `python3.9 -u run_cealdhame.py 2>&1 | tee optimization/pure-python.txt`, with the filenames adjusted as necessary.

## `pure-python.txt`, `pure-python.cast`
The pure-Python version of `cealdhame.py`, as it occurs in [commit 0a329421d5675de3606f9079cf0e9e32102074d7](https://github.com/patrick-brian-mooney/IF-utils/commit/0a329421d5675de3606f9079cf0e9e32102074d7).
