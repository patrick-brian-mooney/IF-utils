# `Optimization/`

Output of various versions of the script, including timing information, as the script is converted from pure-Python to Cython. These occur in both plain-text format and <a rel="muse" href="https://asciinema.org/">ASCIInema</a> JSON (as `.cast` files). ASCIInama `.cast` files are recorded with a terminal size of 150&nbsp;x&nbsp30.

The standard invocation of the script for timing purposes is something very close to `python3.8 -u run_cealdhame.py 2>&1 | tee pure-python.txt`, with the filenames adjusted as necessary.

## `pure-python.txt`, `pure-python.cast`
